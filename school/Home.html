<P>Gift Academy  School is a co-educational international school in Nairobi, Kenya. 
We teach children from age 3 to 18, following the National Curriculum of England and Wales. 
We are a member of the Braeburn Group of International Schools.
The   Gift Academyits beginnings in 200 when a co-educational school called the Nairobi European School began in buildings designed for police Barracks. In 1931 the boys were separated from the girls. In 1935, the school was renamed The European Girls Secondary School and had its first Headmistress, Miss Kerby appointed.
A school website is a communication tool between the school and community; however, its reach can extend beyond country, state lines. A school website may be used by many demographic groups such as staff/administration, parents, students, community, and potential, as well as, former students and alumni. Even across state lines a school website can connect groups of its demographics such as the alumni now living cross country looking for information on the next reunion.

The school website should also maintain communication and interaction with students and parents. It should not be just a mechanical display, so there is no vitality. Although the school website is not required to provide 24-hour customer service like a marketing website, at least there must be an “online message” function to facilitate students, parents to ask questions or suggestions, and then respond promptly</P>
