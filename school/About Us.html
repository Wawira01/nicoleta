		<p>Gift Acadamey school(established 2000) is a co-educational, independent day and boarding school on two Nairobi campuses serving the international community at pre-school, primary and secondary levels.
		A Round Square school and a member of the G-30 group, Gift academy has the pursuit of academic excellence at the centre of its educational philosophy and approach.
		The school is a proud member of Inspired, a leading global premium schools group operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, educating over 31,000 students across a global network of more than 42 schools.
        Gift Academy fosters courage, generosity, imagination, principle and resolve so that our children emerge empowered with the skills and abilities to be the leaders and guardians of tomorrowâ€™s world.
School website can promote teaching, study and communication, and enforce the process of education and achievement. However, people feel confused about what make an efficient and spectacular school website. Countering the progress of technology, the aim and use of school website is still developing.

School web sites, especially in the public sector, are generally under-developed. Lack of expertise among non-teaching staff has been a contributing factor, and many institutions have not acted to make their web presence a priority; these schools perceive themselves as 'stretched' with respect to budgets and time. Requisite skills are sometimes available in the teaching staff, but the investment of their time is not adequately compensated, as stated above.[4]

This general lack of commitment by schools to the internet reflects a limited perception of its capacity to provide educational outcomes for the school community. The 'school website' is viewed as a public face for the school - a more sophisticated newsletter or advertisement. In that regard it is not prioritized. There is now burgeoning interest in the tangible learning benefits a website can generate for a school, and the capacity a website affords for the streamlining of information access within and between faculties, schools and educational departments. Traditionally isolated teachers/faculties are able to network ideas and resources in ways that afford real professional development.</p>
		   Gift School Academy was founded in the year 1983, by the most trusted and philanthropic educational trust, The Ahmedabad Education Society.
